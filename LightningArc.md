# Introduction and Component Based Architecture

### Lightning:

Lightning is the collection of tools and technologies behind a significant upgrade to the Salesforce platform. Itâ€™s a component-based framework.
*	Lightning Component Framework: A JavaScript framework and set of standard components that allow you to build reusable components to customize the Lightning Experience, Salesforce1 Mobile app and template-based communities and build your own standalone apps.
*	Experience: A set of modern user interfaces optimized for speed. This includes the Lightning Experience, Salesforce1 Mobile app and template-based communities.
*	Lightning Design System: Style guides and modern enterprise UX best practices to build pixel perfect apps that match the look and feel of the Lightning Experience and Salesforce1 Mobile app.

*	A special Application component which acts as an outermost container, which can be launched outside the context of the Salesforce1 app.
*	Peer components nested in the application component container.
*	The ability to nest components inside other components.
*	A loosely coupled messaging system across components, enabling them to function as a single application.
*	An example of how components can call Apex action methods using a client-side JavaScript API that provides a service to manage efficient data transport for server-side processing.
